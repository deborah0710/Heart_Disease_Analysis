### Project Overview
This data analysis aims to examine the prevalence of heart diseases and angina pectoris and associated factors among middle-aged and older adults by studying the trends in people with these associated factors. The insights derived from this analysis is to understand the nature and characteristic facts about this category of people, affording them the right knowledge and medication while also enlightening the general population about the causative factors of Angina pectoris (AP).  


### Data Sources
The primary data used for this analysis is the "heart.csv", containing necessary and detailed information about adults from four countries in Europe.

### Tools
- Excel - Data Cleaning and Analysis
- PowerBI - Creating reports

### Data Cleaning/ Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks:

- Data loading and inspection
- Handling missing values
- Data cleaning and formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as:

1. What is the general patients demographics?
2. What is the demographics of people with the likelihood of the heart disease?
3. What role does age and exercise play in the population with the likelihood of the disease?

### Results and Findings
1. Out of the 303 patients whose profiles were explored, 139 had the heart disease making up 45.9% of the sample size while 164(54.1%) were not likely to have the disease.


   
2. The distribution of ages of patients: The average age of the patients is 54 years. The ages of the sample were grouped to make the analysis simpler. It is observed that 39% of the patients in this sample are between the ages 56 to 65 years closely followed by the 46-55 years with 29%. The patients less than 36 years were 2.3% while the 76+ age was mostly negligible.



3. Average maximum heart rate by resting electrocardiographic results and whether exercise caused angina: It is observed that for the category of patients who had ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/ or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV), engaging in strenuous activity such as an exercise had almost no impact on their susceptibility to having angina. The category of patients showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria was the minority and had just about the same susceptibility to angina after an exercise. For the patients in the normal category, the probability of having angina after an exercise is low.

4. It is also observed that the category of people who had the disease had some form of defect with their heart or blood pressure, but many had reversible defects or defects that could be managed. It is also noted that some people with defects did not have the disease.


### Recommendations
It is recommended that there be an inquiry into multiple samples who fit the age profile for an absolute conclusion. By expanding the investigation into this sample and include other attributes of the sample's characteristics. One of such attributes to be inquired further would be the medical history, diet, and family history of the disease, this would give room for other factors to be considered to draw an inference as to the classification of heart disease present in the patients and what different the patients with the absence of the disease.
